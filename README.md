# Media_Processor
A python program that converts .webp images to JPEG and lengthens videos to a decided amount (Default is 30s, Acheved by repeating them). Also copies all PNG, JPEG and MP4 files across to the created folder (Default is "New_art").
Use it by running the python file in the same folder as the files you want to convert.

The linux file should work on mac but it is untested.

### Requires the following python modules:
  - Pillow
  - Moviepy
  - Shutil (Installed by default)
  - os     (Installed be default)
